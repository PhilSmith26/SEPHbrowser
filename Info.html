<h1 style="color:blue ; margin:25px ; "><strong>Canadian SEPH browser</strong></h1>
<h2 style="color:black ; margin:25px ; "> This is a browser for the Canadian Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH). It presents all of the monthly results of this Statistics Canada survey, in both tabular and graphical format. The survey gives a remarkably detailed picture of Canadian employment and payrolls from 2001 to date. If you are interested in this topic, you could easily spend hours effortlessly exploring its features through the lens of the fully up-to-date statistics presented by this browser.<br><br>

Statistics Canada makes the SEPH data available free, online, to anyone who wants to see them. So what is the need for this browser? The need arises (for me anyway) because Statistics Canada's online data tables contain only the basic statistics. While the institution provides a lot of its own excellent analysis of these data, it offers no facility to help users manipulate and chart the data themselves. You can of course download one of the SEPH tables and analyze the numbers on your own, using a spreadsheet or some other software, although this can be cumbersome and time-consuming. Every table and chart displayed by this program contains a footnote reference to the corresponding Statistics Canada online data table from which it is derived.<br><br>

This browser allows you to explore the SEPH data easily, from a number of angles. It works best if you have a moderately large computer screen, but it also works fine on my laptop. The app even works on an iPhone. It easily transforms the basic data by calculating percentage changes and other analytical manipulations. It also helps visualize changes in the statistics through time, by means of graphical representations.<br><br>

Statistics Canada provides the monthly SEPH results in online tables. This browser uses the data in those tables to present the aggregate SEPH dataset in several dimensions. The survey provides data on employment, hours worked and average wages by province and territory and by industry as classified by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). The survey results are derived from a monthly census of employers' personal income tax remittance records, combined with a smaller survey to obtain information on variables not available in the remittance records.<br><br> 

The statistics are remarkably detailed. The data set covers 398 NAICS industries, 14 geographical regions (Canada, provinces and territories), two types of employees (paid by the hour and salaried) and four basic variables: employment, average weekly earnings (AWE), average weekly hours (AWH) and average hourly earnings (AHE). This four-dimensional array has 44,576 cells per month, a level of detail that is really quite extraordinary, although <b><i>many</i></b> of the cells are not available either because of the fact that no companies exist in a particular industry/province-or-territory/type-of-employee combination, or due to confidentiality requirements under the Statistics Act. Unavailable numbers show up in the tables as NA (not available). In the charts they show up as missing sections in the time series line. Sometimes a chart may be completely blank, which might imply the only available observations are outside the chosen time range. You can stretch the sliders to the maximum to find the available data. Naturally, the more narrow the industry/province/employee-type combination, the more likely there will be little or no data. For example, at least some data are available for all of the industries when the focus is on all of Canada and all employees. However, data are available for only 26 industries when the focus is on employees paid by the hour in Nunavut.<br><br>

Some of the tables are seasonally adjusted by Statistics Canada and some are not. The seasonally adjusted ones are tables 1 to 4 in this browser. They are the ones that will be of most interest from a macroeconomic perspective, as they are fairly highly aggregated. The tables with data that are not seasonally adjusted are of use when drilling down to three- or four-digit NAICS industries, or when focussing on the smaller provinces and territories. The smaller the industry and/or the province or territory, the more likely there are to be breaks in the time series and when there are breaks, there is no seasonal adjustment. However, in the chart tabs for tables that have not been seasonally adjusted by Statistics Canada, there is a switch to seasonally adjust, optionally, a series that is being plotted. This functionality has two requirements. First, the adjustment is done using the time series range as specified using the sliders. If this length is not 5 calendar years or more, seasonal adjustment will not be done. Second, seasonal adjustment will not be done if there are any NA values in the selected range for the time series. The seasonal adjustment switch indicates whether or not you want seasonal adjustment, not whether the seasonal adjustment, if requested, was successful. You can see whether seasonal adjustment was actually done or not in the last line of the chart title.<br><br> 

You are presently reading from the 'Introduction and explanation' tab. The second tab lists the tables that are available in this browser. All of them contain statistics from January 2001 to date. The other 11 tabs present the tables themselves.

<h1 style="color:blue ; margin:25px ; "><strong>How to use the browser</strong></h1>
<h2 style="color:black ; margin:25px ; ">It is straightforward and intuitive to use this browser. You select one of the 11 tables by clicking on its table number. When you do so, you are presented sub-tabs offering two choices: tables or charts.<br><br>

If you choose the tables option, you are presented with a flexible table. Radio buttons allow you to specify aspects of the table you want to see. For example, if the table shows employment over time in a set of industries, the buttons might let you choose which province or territory, or whether you want salaried, hourly or all employees. The time range to be displayed is selectable, using a slider. It is possible to display a very wide table, stretching from January 2001 to date for example, which would scroll across the screen, or a narrow table displaying just a few months. For example, if you want to focus on the COVID-19 period you could move the slider to the range February 2020 to date. You can also choose a 'window' of arbitrary length and move that window to different locations by clicking and dragging in the middle of the slider bar.<br><br>

The table browser also allows you to display some basic transformations of the statistics. The available ones are:<br><br>
- Original table (no transformation),<br>
- Indexed, starting month = 100,<br>
- One-month percentage change,<br>
- Twelve-month percentage change<br><br>

There is a button on the right of the screen, above the display of a table, that can be used to download a copy of the table. The downloaded '.csv' file contains the data you selected, covering the time range displayed, and if you choose one of the transformations, the downloaded data will have that transformation.<br><br>

You can also choose to plot one of the time series in the table. You will see the same radio buttons in the charts sub-tab as in the tables sub-tab, together with a text box within which are the options from which you can pick to draw your chart. Usually, though not always, these options consist of a list of industries. As with the tables sub-tab, you can also choose to transform the statistics in various ways before charting. In addition, there is a button on the right, above the graphical display, that can be used to download the chart that is on the screen as a '.png' file.<br><br>

There is also a box allowing you to specify, at your option, a different title for a chart. This option is provided because the default chart title is the Statistics Canada line caption for the chosen line in the table. For one reason or another, if you want to download the chart you might prefer to specify a different title.<br><br>

And as mentioned earlier, for tables that contain statistics that have not been seasonally adjusted by Statistics Canada, there is a switch that allows you to seasonally adjust a series yourself before plotting it.
